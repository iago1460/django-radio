Release notes & upgrade information
###################################

Some versions of RadioCo present more complex upgrade paths than others, and
some **require** you to take action. It is strongly recommended to read the
release notes carefully when upgrading.

It goes without saying that you should **backup your database** before embarking
on any process that makes changes to your database.
